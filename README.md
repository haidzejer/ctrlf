#Project 03: Ctrl+F
---
**Ctrl + F** is an online platform that offers two essential functionalities that do not currently exist: One is to review webpages within a web-search application and two, to add additional information such as comments and users’ suggested results to web queries in order to improve search algorithms and therefore to add value to the users’ web-search experience.

###Project Procedure
- Product Decision: Our team reached a consesus based on anaylizing what users primarily use search engines for. We wanted to develop a search engine where one can both search and add data to the result.
- Work distribution: After scoping out the project, work was distriubted based on the final merge point, which was the search result render with our application data appended. 
- Communication: Combination of individual work and paired-programming required our team to communicate frequently and think in parallel to each other.
- Polish & Publish: With the MVP accomplishment, we added additional features and polished the interface for better user experience.

###MVP

Users are able to query/search for the results and also able to view/add comments on the page. Both the original result and added comments viewable in the same page.
